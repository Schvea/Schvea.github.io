        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <hr class="w3-opacity">
        <p>I wish to learn more about the programming language JavaScript. I have worked with Javascript before and
            I am stubborn to learn more about this versatile language. I need to learn more css. I have been putting
            off working with css because of how deep the understanding needs to be from the
            developer to deliver good expected results. It is very much needed and I need to work on my skills to
            deliver better results as a Front end Developer.
        </p>

            <h2>Why would I be a good programmer?</h2>
            <hr class="w3-opacity">
            <p>I would be a good programmer because I appreciate clear directions and requirements as much as I enjoy
                the creative freedom that different programming languages offer. The never ending learning process of
                understanding code is a strong motivator for me to expand my knowledge and learn more languages.

                    <p>My name is Svea, I'm a 19 year old girl with Asperger's syndrome. I began programming two years
                        ago when I decided to explore some new interests. My first experience with code was introduced
                        to me by my school, we worked with markup languages like HTML5. After one year of weekly coding
                        lessons, I was forced to quit my studies for medical reasons. I soon became restless and found
                        new ways to continue my journey into the industry. I managed to get an internship at Cisco and
                        have now worked in a team of Javascript developers with a wide range of expertise in the
                        industry for about half a year. My internship is now coming to an end and I am very inspired by
                        the gifted developers in my team to learn even more and become better. I intend on working as a
                        software developer in the future as I cannot (and do not want to) imagine myself doing anything
                        else.
